# Chinese restaurant simulation

This application simulates user traffic in a Chinese restaurant and serves as a tool for predicting the average waiting time for service and the length of queues. It models the behavior of restaurant workers and various systems, including the fire protection system. The intervals separating time events within the system are represented by random variables following a normal or exponential distribution.

## Type of simulation

 - Object-oriented computer simulation of discrete-event system
 - Random, dynamic system model
 - Process interaction method
 - Doubly linked event list
